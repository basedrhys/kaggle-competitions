# Kaggle Competition Notebooks
A collection of my submissions for different Kaggle competitions, supplied as colab notebooks

Note: If a competition allows public code sharing (which most do these days) then I'll publish my submissions as I work on them. If they don't then I'll wait until the competition has ended to upload my code.

## Image Classification

### [APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection)

This competition tasks competitors with detecting the severity of diabetic retinopathy in patients - how bad is their blindness. This is done via eye imaging.

## Tabular Data

### [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)

This is the de facto starting ML competition. To get good results in this tabular dataset you'll need to hone your feature engineering skills.
