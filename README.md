# Kaggle Competition Notebooks
A collection of my submissions for different Kaggle competitions, supplied as colab notebooks

Note: If a competition allows public code sharing then I'll publish my submissions as I work on them. If they don't then I'll wait until the competition has ended to upload my code.

This competition tasks competitors with detecting the severity of diabetic retinopathy in patients - how bad is their blindness. This is done via eye imaging.
